On-the-fly GC is a concurrent mark-sweep garbage collector intended
for accurate garbage collection of language runtimes written in C++
1x.  It implements the sliding views technique described in the paper
"An on-the-fly mark and sweep garbage collector based on sliding
views", which is available at

http://grothoff.org/christian/teaching/2007/4705/ms-sliding-views.pdf

A goal of on-the-fly is to deliver extremely low mutator pause times,
on the order of tens of microseconds, independently of heap size.
